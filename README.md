## Scope

The main reason I worked on this game was to learn more about the art and animation side of Unity. Since my drawing skills are awful, I decided to trace over 
actual photos and use keyframe animations from those traces. A lot of the sounds I recorded myself, including the realoding, so it was just a case of 
matching it all up. 

With the idea of working more on creating an actual game, and not just a series of bland, geometrical shapes, I started to expand with pixel art, tilemaps,
working with animation and sorting layers, as well as some of the other features of Unity I never touched before: Cinemachine, Animators, and bespoke 2D libraries
such as Raytracing2D.

## Code

Another main focus of this project was integrating GitHub, and actually use some version control for a change. I programmed everything myself *except* the AI, which I bought
an asset pack for. The reason for this is because Unity doesn't offer any NavMesh abilities for a top down, 2D perspective. In fact the top down perspective isn't supported 
well at all, and I had a bit of a battle getting the initial movement working. 

I had never worked with a 2D game before, so it was good learning how to code for that. I finally started to learn more about OOP, and used this game as an opportunity to 
pass arguments to classes in other functions, as well as make objects interact with each other from their respective classes.

## Plan

I originally intended the camera to be static and for the player to only be able to move in a sqaure fashion in the fixed camera while zombies spawn and come towards the player.
As I started to get everything up and running I thought a bit of a linear, survival focus would be better. From that I started to plan more on what I wanted: I wanted the 
player to start in a house or flat and try to escape a city. The focus on reloading and collecting ammo was a huge part, and I wanted the player to choose when to reload,
and try to be consious of running a mag empty, as it adds another second to the reload time. 

I also intended for three levels, but by the time I finished the second I had already got as far as I wanted with the code and learned what I could from a programming and art
perspective. Since it's not exactly game of the year material, I couldn't be arsed to sit down and create more textures and plan out another map. 

Another feature I wanted was weapon jams. If the gun jammed the player would have to hit "R" to unjam. However, by the time I got my code up to a good level, adding this in
would mean rewriting a lot of the code. This is a great positive for me, since it's a good lesson on planning, and building the initial base bit-by-bit with all of
(or most) of the intended features, rather than perfecting onc feature, then realising you have to re-do most of it to add something in.
